    <h1 class="font1">Final Year Project</h1><h2 class="font2">Sign Language Interpreter</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Developed a cutting-edge real-time sign language interpreter, leveraging advanced Python libraries including
                OpenCV, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, Ski-Learn and LSTM. Using Malaysia Sign Languages, this project harnesses the power of computer vision to accurately
                recognize hand and finger positions, translating complex sign language gestures into text. The solution is
                designed to enhance communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals, bridging the gap between
                sign language users and the broader community. Images shown are the sign performed on 4 different situations, plain background, crowded background, good lighting and bad lighting.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Engineered a robust library management system by identifying relational keys and designing both ER and EER diagrams.
                These diagrams were meticulously mapped to relational schemas, enabling the execution of advanced SQL queries through
                relational algebra and calculus. The project emphasized efficient data modeling and maintaining database integrity,
                ensuring smooth and reliable library operations. Relations that involved in this project are Staff, Member, Borrow, Book, Author, Publisher, Reservation and Fine. Image shown is the ER Diagram.</p>

    <h1 class="font1">Class Project</h1><h2 class="font2">Brick Breaker Game</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Brought the classic arcade experience to life by developing a Brick Breaker Game with a modern twist, all powered by the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. The project was an exciting journey into game development, where I skillfully utilized 2D arrays to efficiently manage the game's bricks, ensuring smooth gameplay and dynamic interactions. </p>
            <p>Through the use of OOP principles, I crafted a modular and reusable codebase, which not only made the game easy to maintain but also laid the foundation for future enhancements and scalability. This project was a thrilling exploration of coding techniques, problem-solving, and creativity, resulting in a fun and challenging game that embodies both technical rigor and a passion for development.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Designed and implemented an innovative solution to tackle the real-world challenges faced by lettuce farmers, specifically targeting the optimization of crop yield and sustainability. The Automatic Plant Controller system is a testament to the power of technology in agriculture, utilizing Arduino to monitor and autonomously correct critical factors like soil moisture and temperature.</p>
            <p>By continuously assessing these essential environmental variables, the system can proactively adjust conditions to ensure optimal growth. This project not only demonstrated my ability to integrate hardware and software but also highlighted the potential of smart agriculture solutions to transform traditional farming practices, making them more efficient and sustainable.</p>

    <h1 class="font1">Competition</h1><h2 class="font2">ROBOCON Malaysia 2023</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Robocon Malaysia 2023 was an exhilarating event held from June 10th to 13th at Universiti Sains Malaysia, Engineering Campus in Nibong Tebal, Penang. This year’s theme, “Casting Flowers Over Angkor Wat,” was inspired by the rich cultural heritage of Cambodia, the host country for the ABU Robocon 202312.</p>
            <p>The game involved two types of robots: the Rabbit Robot and the Elephant Robot. Teams had to design and build these robots to work together in casting flowers over a model of Angkor Wat. The Rabbit Robot was responsible for picking up flowers and passing them to the Elephant Robot, which then cast the flowers over the structure. The challenge required precision, coordination, and innovative engineering to ensure the flowers landed accurately on the designated spots</p>
            <p>Our team won the 4th place!</p>

    <h1 class="font1">Competition</h1><h2 class="font2">ROBOCON Malaysia 2022</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Robocon Malaysia 2022 was an exciting event held from June 2nd to 5th at Universiti Sains Malaysia, Engineering Campus in Nibong Tebal, Penang. The theme for this year’s competition was “Lagori-Tuju Tin,” inspired by the traditional Indian game Lagori, also known as Tuju Tin or Baling Tin in Malaysia12.</p>
            <p>The game involved two teams, each with two robots: Robot 1 (R1) and Robot 2 (R2). The teams were divided into Seekers and Hitters. The Seekers’ task was to break a stone tower called Lagori and then pile up the stones again, while the Hitters aimed to disrupt this process by throwing balls at the Seekers1.</p>
            <p>Seeker Robots: R1 was responsible for breaking the Lagori discs, while R2 piled them up in the original order. R2 also had a “Ball on Head” mechanism, which added an extra layer of challenge as the Hitters aimed to displace this ball.</p>
            <p>Hitter Robots: R1 and R2 worked together to pick up balls and throw them at the Seekers, trying to prevent them from completing their task1.</p>
            <p>The game required a combination of speed, accuracy, and strategic planning. The robots could be either manual or automatic, allowing teams to showcase their engineering creativity and technical skills</p>
