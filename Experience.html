During my internship at Soft Device Sdn. Bhd. in Batu Caves, Selangor, I gained hands-on experience in the intricate world of electronics over the course of two and a half months. I was actively involved in producing and managing printed circuit boards, where I ensured their quality through rigorous product testing. I also had the opportunity to construct and refine circuit boards for both new and existing products, playing a key role in their development. This experience deepened my understanding of circuit analysis and sharpened my ability to interpret complex schematic diagrams, all of which were essential to the success of the projects I worked on.</p>
